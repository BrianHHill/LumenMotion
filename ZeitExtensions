  1. Sound Activations for Light
    Concept: Activate dangling lure with light based on audio signal in.
    Reference Pattern: LED cap - sound activated - https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/08/24/sound-sensitive-led-baseball-cap-wearablewednesday/
    Components
      AdaFruit Gemma microcontroller
        https://www.adafruit.com/products/1222
      Electret Microphone
        https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063
      LEDs
        Stock from ZeitFish (12v)
      Power
        TBC - needs either separate or inline switchable with main 12v supply
  
  Feature: "Swimming in an Ocean of Connectivity"
  
  2. Bluetooth Signal Detection + Response
    Concept: Detect and respond to adjacent Bluetooth signals as a visible 'bluetooth-pulse'
    Reference Pattern:
    Components
      
  3. WiFi Signal Detection + Response
    Concept: Detect and respond to adjacent WiFi signals as a visible 'wifi-pulse', with higher intensity lighting or pulsing frequency
    reflecting higher signal strenth and vice versa
    Reference Pattern:
    Components
      
  4. Motion Activation
  Concept: Detect 3d motion and generate illumination response proportionate to amplitude. High deceleration/acceleration = higher luminosity
